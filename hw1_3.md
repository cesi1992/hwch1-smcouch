Whenever a prefetched data stream from memory is significantly shorter than a memory page, the prefetcher tends to bring in more data than needed [O62]. This effect is ameliorated -- but not eliminated -- by the ability of the hardware to cancel prefetch streams if too many prefetch requests queue up. Note that if the stream gets very short, TLB misses will be another important factor to consider. See Section 3.4 for details.
