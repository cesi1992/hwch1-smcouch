As explained in Section 1.2.3, `ofs=1` stalls the pipeline in iteration i until iteration `iâˆ’1` is complete. The duration of the stall is very close to the depth of the pipeline. If ofs is increased, the stall will take fewer and fewer cycles until finally, if `ofs` gets larger than the pipeline depth, the stalls vanish. Note that we neglect the possible impact of the recursion on the compiler's ability to vectorize the code using SIMD instructions.
